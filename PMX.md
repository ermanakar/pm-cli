# PMCLI Project Context

## Vision

PMCLI (pmx) is a CLI tool for technical founders and product engineers. It bridges the gap between product strategy and code execution.

## Core Principles

1. **Read-Heavy, Write-Light**: Analyze deeply, modify carefully.
2. **Context-Aware**: Understand the specific project structure.
3. **Terminal-First**: Live where the engineer lives.

## Architecture

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **LLM**: OpenAI (default), pluggable architecture.
- **Interface**: REPL with slash commands.
